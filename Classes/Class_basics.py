Object Oriented Programming
Object Oriented Programming is concept where everything can be treated as an object.
Declaring any type of variable and it's value can be treated as an object.
e.g. Human can be an example: Human is an object, it has properties/attributes which can define the Human as an object.
It can have 'head', 'eyes', 'ears', 'arms' , 'body' , 'legs', 'voice', 'name', etc.. as a property or attribute.
Then we can use all that attributes or not - to define methods inside the objects. Example: Human can sing the words, so we can create one method which will print all that value for particular object.
Imagine car as an object, car can have mark, model, year, type, etc.. as an attribute. With all of those information we can create one or more methods inside Car which can represent Start, Stop, Moving, Braking as a functions/methods.
